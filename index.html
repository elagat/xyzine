    <h2>Interview with Maroula Blades</h2>
    <ul>
      <li id="qu">How is your identity an important part of your poetry? How do you understand "identity politics"?</li>
      <li>As a person of colour seen by the white establishment as the “other”, it is important to reveal
my identity through creative practices. Whether that be writing a poem or prose, singing and
playing music or art. I cannot deny my identity, it is a feature of my heritage. An inherent part
of me that provides a unique perspective on current and past events. These events led
minorities to a definite disadvantage in life. History books are written from the “white gaze”,
meaning the view of the white colonizers which we know to be flawed. Minority parties have
always recorded their place and deeds in the world. But seldom were they taken into
consideration. Because of this, the “others” must propagate their needs, aspirations, qualms,
and histories. Writing is a fantastic vehicle for this. We must do it much as possible. Change
must come! And if one’s fortunate to find a platform, the chronicles and messages will be
published, recorded, shared, or filmed for present and future generations.</li>
<li>My understanding of the term “identity politics” is that it deals with political ideologies and
strategies. Significance is put on the group to which individuals perceive themselves as
belonging to, corresponding to their race, gender (whether they are male or female), or
sexual orientation (whether they prefer intimate relations with people of the same or a
different gender).</li>
      <li id="qu">Do you believe we are in a new era? If so, what is this the era of?</li>
      <li>Yes, we’re in a new era to a certain extent, but we are still in a patriarchal age. The age of
equality is blinking on the horizon. Some might consider this to be the “woke” era. But a
great deal more has to happen, regarding socio-political issues, etc.</li>
      <li>Since the recent Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, a vital shift is taking place in the
literary field which encompasses a few more diverse voices. Women are now coming to the
foreground in politics. Valid changes are being made to benefit women and children, i.e.,
equal pay, inclusive educational methods, employment opportunities, and providing safe
working environments. Today, from an early age, teachers encourage female children to
choose recreational classes that were usually reserved for boys and vice-visa. Also, the LGBT
social movements have provided much-needed clarification on the needs of gay, transexual,
and non-binary peoples.</li>
      <li>Today, in European commercials, whether it be for fashion industry, insurance companies,
public transport, banks, etc., many of the models are multicultural. This is a positive step.
Earlier, more often than not, minorities occupied demeaning roles in the media.</li>
      <li id="qu">Tell us about embodying the voice of Harriet Tubman in "Flight."</li>
      <li>It was important to me to embody the voice of Harriet Tubman in “Flight” as she was a
brave, remarkable woman. She seized her own freedom and then she guided hundreds of
African American slaves to theirs, including her brothers. Harriet Tubman is called “The
Moses of Her People” because like Moses she helped people escape from captivity.</li>
<li>For inspiration, I read an online volume of “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman” by Sarah
H. Bradford, issued by W.J. Moses, printer, 1869. And I researched the way Southern Black
slaves spoke during that dark period. I wanted the expression in “Flight” to be authentic,
hence the use of dialect. It was also enjoyable to write about Harriet Tubman, a heroine of
mine, because we seldom address the accomplishments of black women in history as their
roles are often diminished or even erased.</li>
      <li id="qu">How do you like your allies?</li>
      <li>I like my allies to come from diverse backgrounds, to be like-minded and accepting of others.
Egos must remain outside in the pen. It would serve us better if we could all initiate
wholesome dialogues. White allies should not ask people of colour to explain current and past
events associated with racial tension. For it causes discomfort and may trigger unpleasant
feelings and memories. They should have the insight to find ways that will educate themselves
on these issues. It would be supportive if they shared the knowledge gained with other white
allies. Nowadays, there are many online forums, articles and movements that address race-
related topics. For example, the ongoing discussions about the torn down statues which
represent white racial supremacy. As well as the defacing and removal of the Columbus
statues. He is accused of the genocide of indigenous people.</li>
