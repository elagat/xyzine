  <section class="about">
    <h2>About Wolf Jaw Magazine</h2>
    <p>Wolf Jaw Magazine stands for the democratization of quality internet. We want access to good poetry being written today, not mere scraps from the social media bent on selling us something or just "potentially" interesting journals resting on their laurels and requiring handsome subscription fees.</p>
    <p>We demand quality now.</p>
    <p>Sole founder Emily Lagattolla is a linguist and poet with a literature degree and teaching chops. She loves to cook hearty meals, practice meditation, and pet her cat. She believes art is for the people and should not be sequestered. She thanks you for the opportunity to read your poetry and welcomes you to the siteâ€”and the movement.</p>
